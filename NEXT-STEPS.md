# 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

You now have everything you need to deploy bigtorig-mcp-hub! Here's what to do RIGHT NOW:

---

## ⏸️ STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://github.com/organizations/mindset-dev/repositories/new
2. Name: `bigtorig-mcp-hub`
3. Description: "MCP Server for Hostinger Infrastructure Services"
4. Public repository
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README
6. Click "Create repository"

✅ **PAUSE - Confirm:** Repository created? Reply "yes" to continue.

---

## ⏸️ STEP 2: Upload Files (3 minutes)

I've created all your files in the outputs folder. You have two options:

### Option A: Using Git (Command Line)

```bash
# Navigate to where you want the repo
cd ~/projects  # or wherever you keep code

# Copy all files from outputs
cp -r /path/to/outputs/bigtorig-mcp-hub .
cd bigtorig-mcp-hub

# Initialize and push
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: FastMCP hub for bigtorig.com"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/mindset-dev/bigtorig-mcp-hub.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option B: Using GitHub Web UI (Easier)

1. Go to your new repo
2. Click "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag and drop all files from the outputs folder
4. Commit directly to main

✅ **PAUSE - Confirm:** Files uploaded? Reply "yes" to continue.

---

## ⏸️ STEP 3: Pin the Repository (1 minute)

1. Go to: https://github.com/journeyman33
2. Click "Customize your pins" (below your profile picture)
3. Add these 6 repos in order:
   - mindset-dev/ai-infra-hostinger
   - journeyman33/kubernetes-resume-challenge
   - journeyman33/kodekloud
   - journeyman33/hugo-site
   - journeyman33/k8s-resume-blog
   - mindset-dev/bigtorig-mcp-hub ← NEW!
4. Click "Save pins"

✅ **PAUSE - Confirm:** Pins updated? Reply "yes" to continue.

---

## ⏸️ STEP 4: Test Locally (Optional - 5 minutes)

Only if you want to test before deploying to K8s:

```bash
cd bigtorig-mcp-hub

# Install UV if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# (You don't need to fill it in for basic testing)

# Run the server
uv run python src/server.py
```

In another terminal:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Should return:
```json
{"status": "healthy", "service": "bigtorig-mcp-hub", "version": "0.1.0", ...}
```

✅ **PAUSE - Confirm:** Local test worked? Or skip this step?
